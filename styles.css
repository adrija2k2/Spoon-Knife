/* Reset default margin and padding values for all elements */

{
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
box-sizing: border-box;
}
/* Style for the octocat image */
#octocat {
display: block;
max-width: 100%;
margin: 50px auto;
}

/* Style for the paragraph text */
p {
max-width: 600px;
margin: 50px auto;
font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
font-size: 24px;
line-height: 1.5;
text-align: center;
}

In this modified code, I changed the universal selector to include box-sizing: border-box, which will ensure that padding and border values are included in the element's total width and height. For the #octocat selector, I changed the width property to max-width to ensure the image is responsive and won't overflow its container. I also changed the font-family for the p selector to Arial and adjusted the font-size and line-height for better readability. Finally, I added a text-align property to center the paragraph text.
